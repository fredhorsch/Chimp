### Project 🐒
Chimp is our project from the fall semester 2020. This project aims to build a desktop application for a CRM (Customer relationship management) tool, to manage most efficiently a team, customer, and your daily tasks. 

### Goal 🎯
The goal was to build a Webpage for our project Chimp. The aim was to create a codebase that is easy to adapt, with different input and images, and which is also responsive for different screen sizes.

### Features 📱
* Design of the Webpage.
* Structured CODE and easy to edit.
* Responsive Design.

### Challenges 🧨
Before I started programming the website I only had the basic knowledge about web development. Accordingly, the challenge was to keep the website structured and responsive for all screen sizes. Another challenge was that we didn't have a designer in the team and so I took over the design part of the website as well.

## Webpage 💿
Open the Webpage of CHIMP with the following link: [Chimp](http://www.chimp.berlin/).
